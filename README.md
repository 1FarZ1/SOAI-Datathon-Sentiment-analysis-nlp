- My Attemp To Solve The Sentiment Analysis Challenge in the Soai Bejaia Datathon TrainIt Challange : Decode The Vipe : Analyse Social Media Sentiment Using NLP

## Output

- This Model need to predict which class the text of the test.csv file belongs to. The output file should contain 2 columns: the first one is the text and the second one is the sentiment. The sentiment have 5 different values : happy , sad , anxiety , angry , none

## Notes

- in this Notebook , you can find detailled steps to solve the challenge and the code to implement the solution. i got accuracy of 0.92 on the test set using a simple Xgboosy model. and i got the third place with it in the competition. best solution i guess is to fine tune Logistic Regression model , using the Grid Search CV
